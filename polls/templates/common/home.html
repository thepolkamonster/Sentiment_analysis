            <p>Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that
                involves determining and extracting the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text, such
                as a sentence, paragraph, or document. The goal of sentiment analysis is to understand the attitude,
                opinion, or sentiment conveyed by the text, whether it is positive, negative, neutral, or somewhere in
                between.

                Sentiment analysis typically involves classifying text into one or more categories, such as <br>
                <br>
                <b>Positive: Text expressing a favorable or positive sentiment.</b> <br>
                <b>Negative: Text expressing an unfavorable or negative sentiment.</b> <br>
                <b>Neutral: Text that does not convey a particularly positive or negative sentiment.</b> <br>
                <b>Mixed: Text containing both positive and negative sentiments.</b> <br>
                <br>
                Sentiment analysis can be applied to various types of text data, including product reviews, social media
                posts, customer feedback, news articles, and more. It has numerous practical applications, including:
                <br>

                Customer feedback analysis: Businesses use sentiment analysis to understand how customers feel about
                their products or services, helping them improve customer satisfaction. <br>

                Social media monitoring: Companies and organizations monitor social media platforms to gauge public
                sentiment and respond to customer inquiries or concerns. <br>

                Market research: Sentiment analysis can be used to analyze market trends and predict consumer behavior
                based on sentiment data. <br>

                Reputation management: Brands and individuals use sentiment analysis to track and manage their online
                reputation by identifying and responding to negative comments or reviews. <br>

                Political analysis: Sentiment analysis is employed in politics to understand public opinion and gauge
                the popularity of political candidates or issues. <br>

                <b> Sentiment analysis can be performed using various techniques, ranging from simple rule-based
                    approaches to more advanced machine learning models.
                    Machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Na√Øve Bayes, and deep learning
                    methods like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers,
                    have been increasingly popular for accurate sentiment analysis tasks. These models are trained on
                    labeled datasets to learn the relationships between words or phrases and sentiment categories,
                    allowing them to make predictions on new, unseen text. </b>
